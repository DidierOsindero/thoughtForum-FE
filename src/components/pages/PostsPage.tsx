            <p className="postContent">
              The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, often shortened to
              Hamlet (/ˈhæmlɪt/), is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare
              sometime between 1599 and 1601. It is Shakespeare's longest play,
              with 29,551 words. Set in Denmark, the play depicts Prince Hamlet
              and his attempts to exact revenge against his uncle, Claudius, who
              has murdered Hamlet's father in order to seize his throne and
              marry Hamlet's mother.
